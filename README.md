<h3>Using Jira to visualise tasks</h3>
<br>
To visualise the progress of the application, and have a reference for completed, in progress, and outstanding tasks a Jira Kanban board was used to store epics,  
user stories and tasks. Epics are Large Parts of the code base that provide a lot of functionality that is broken down into User Stories and Tasks associated with  
the Epic. Below is a screenshot of the Jira Board for the project (also the Board is linked at the top of this document):
